                    <p id="texto1">"I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best- and most gruelling- time of my life. Since completing the course. I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup." </p>

                <p id="destaque1kira">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
                <p id="texto1kira">"Before joining the bootcamp, i've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. the entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistence. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, i've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend"</p>

The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.
